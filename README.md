# RSI Videofied tcp / mqtt gateway

This is a simple gateway between RSI Videofied alarm system and MQTT server.
!! I only tested with the RSI protocol V2 !!
It's integrated with [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant) (automatic creation of sensors through MQTT)

# Test server
You can send specifics events to test the server. You can find a test script in tests/test_server_python2.py
```
python2.7 tests/test_server_python2.py
```

# My events list (have to change with your own system)
You have to test your own system with arm / disarm / open panel etc .. to find the corrects IDs, please start container in DEBUG mode.
FYI: I haven't all events yet
